                <h2>Welcome to Op-Ed Bingo!</h2>
                <p>This game will help you become familiar with the <strong>op-ed genre</strong> by identifying the key rhetorical moves that define it.</p>
                <p>Let's walk through how to play! 👉</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 2 -->
            <div class="tutorial-step" data-step="2">
                <h2>Understanding Your Bingo Card</h2>
                <p>Your bingo card is populated with <strong>writerly moves</strong> that define the op-ed genre.</p>
                <p>Not every op-ed makes all of these moves, but most can be found in most op-eds. These are the building blocks of effective opinion writing!</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 3 -->
            <div class="tutorial-step" data-step="3">
                <h2>How the Game Works</h2>
                <p><strong>Step 1:</strong> Your professor will call out a specific rhetorical move from your bingo card.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 2:</strong> You'll have a limited amount of time to locate a passage in one of the provided op-eds that makes that move.</p>
                <p><strong>Step 3:</strong> Once you find an example, highlight it and tag it with the corresponding move!</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 4 -->
            <div class="tutorial-step" data-step="4">
                <h2>Highlighting & Tagging Passages</h2>
                <p>Switch to the <strong>"Sample Op-Eds"</strong> tab and open any article. When you find a passage that demonstrates a rhetorical move:</p>
                <ul style="text-align: left; margin: 20px 40px; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li><strong>Highlight the text</strong> by selecting it with your mouse</li>
                    <li><strong>Click the highlighted text</strong> to see a menu of all rhetorical moves</li>
                    <li><strong>Select the move</strong> that matches your passage</li>
                </ul>
                <p>💡 <strong>Tip:</strong> Keep your selections brief but meaningful (usually 1-2 sentences)!</p>
            </div>

            <!-- Step 5 -->
            <div class="tutorial-step" data-step="5">
                <h2>Review & Save Your Entry</h2>
                <p>After selecting a move, you'll automatically see a dialog box with:</p>
                <ul style="text-align: left; margin: 20px 40px; line-height: 1.8;">
                    <li><strong>Your highlighted passage</strong> - already filled in for you</li>
                    <li><strong>Source information</strong> - bibliographical data automatically added</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Review the entry and click <strong>"Save"</strong> to mark the square on your bingo card. You can always click a square later to view or edit what you've saved!</p>

                text: `<p><strong>FLINT, Mich.</strong> — The summer before my junior year of high school, I boarded an airplane for the first time. Three hours later I was in picture-perfect New England, where I was soon to be surrounded by a diverse and extremely accomplished group of peers. I had been awarded a generous scholarship to attend the Phillips Exeter summer semester — five weeks of classes and sports, with some optional SAT prep mixed in.</p>

<p>I'm from Flint, Mich., and even though I recently transferred to a private Catholic high school in my city, top tier-education is new to my family. Neither of my parents went to college, and in Rust Belt regions like the middle of Michigan, education is falling behind the rest of the country. Stanford researchers found, for example, that sixth graders in our town are two to three grade levels behind the national average. They are almost five grade levels behind students in more prosperous counties 30 miles away.</p>

<p>The friends I made at Phillips Exeter were from fancy-sounding towns and seemed to have it all. Most attended prestigious private or highly ranked public schools. They were impossibly sporty, charming and intelligent, with perfect smiles and impeccably curated Instagram profiles. The program we attended costs around $10,000, so they were clearly affluent, but they also came from diverse backgrounds. They had been on exotic vacations and had volunteered for the needy. They were truly interesting people.</p>

<p>So I didn't understand why so many of them were enrolled in the optional SAT prep section of our summer program. Why would such impressive high achievers spend their summer nights storming through a massive SAT book? Many of them already took weekend SAT prep courses back home. Did they just think it was fun to time one another on practice sets?</p>

<p>Family and friends from home thought it was weird that I went to "school" during my summers, but the kids at Exeter saw summer academic programs as normal and enjoyable. I was happy to be around so many fellow nerds. Still, they approached studying for the SAT with a near-professional intensity that was alien to me.</p>

<p>I realized that they didn't just want to score exceptionally well on the SAT. They were gunning for a score on the Preliminary SAT exams that would put them in the top percentile of students in the United States and make them National Merit Scholars in the fall.</p>

<p>It was disconcerting. The majority of low- and middle-income 11th graders I know in Michigan didn't even sit for the preliminary exams. Most took the SAT cold. Few were privy to the upper-middle-class secret I discovered that summer: To get into elite colleges, one must train for standardized tests with the intensity of an athlete.</p>

<p>If I lost the ZIP code lottery growing up in tap-water-crisis Flint, my new friends had won the neighborhood Powerball jackpot. They grew up in what the social scientist Charles Murray calls "Super ZIPs," areas where almost everyone is wealthy, highly educated and connected.</p>

<p>Don't get me wrong. My newfound friends worked extremely hard, but they also seemed to have access to a formula for success that had been kept from the rest of us. It just wasn't something our overworked guidance counselors could teach.</p>

<p>As a result, all the drilling they did for an exam that is supposed to be an equalizer in ranking students according to raw test-taking skills was only widening the American achievement gap.</p>

<p>I had opted out of Exeter's SAT prep. So the following fall, when I posted a so-so SAT score, I went into Super-ZIP-kid mode.</p>

<p>I couldn't afford a $3,000 40-hour prep course or tutor. But I could take out test prep books at the public library. There were very few checkout stamps on the book jackets, so I kept renewing them. I also took a $99 online program I heard about on NPR and Khan Academy's free SAT section. On Saturdays, I commuted an hour each way to Ann Arbor for a free test-prep program at the University of Michigan.</p>

<p>My post-prep score saw a solid pop, and that awarded me access to tens of thousands in automatic merit awards to local colleges. I was encouraged to throw my hat in the ring at some more selective universities.</p>

<p>The bottom line is that students like me — from middle- to low-income families, who live in less prosperous areas of the country — tend to stumble upon opportunities by luck (if at all). My summer-school friends knew to compete for generous merit awards. They understood they had to transform themselves into perfect applicants for a competitive college and employment market that draws students from all over the world.</p>

<p>This past month, I watched many of these friends dazzle their social media followers with acceptance letters from Northwestern, Harvard, Williams and Duke, as well as six-figure Presidential Scholarships to various public universities. Their success was hard-earned and I am proud of them. I only wish that more lower- and middle-income peers knew how to pursue such aggressive strategies.</p>

                text: `<p><strong>CHARLOTTESVILLE, Va.</strong> — Each week, I seek out the office hours of a philosophy department professor willing to discuss with me complex ethical questions raised by her course on gender and sexuality. We keep our voices low, as if someone might overhear us.</p>

<p>Hushed voices and anxious looks dictate so many conversations on campus here at the University of Virginia, where I'm finishing up my senior year.</p>

<p>A friend lowers her voice to lament the ostracizing of a student who said something well-meaning but mildly offensive during a student club's diversity training. Another friend shuts his bedroom door when I mention a lecture defending Thomas Jefferson from contemporary criticism. His roommate might hear us, he explains.</p>

<p>I went to college to learn from my professors and peers. I welcomed an environment that champions intellectual diversity and rigorous disagreement. Instead, my college experience has been defined by strict ideological conformity. Students of all political persuasions hold back — in class discussions, in friendly conversations, on social media — from saying what we really think. Even as a liberal who has attended abortion rights demonstrations and written about standing up to racism, I sometimes feel afraid to fully speak my mind.</p>

<p>In the classroom, backlash for unpopular opinions is so commonplace that many students have stopped voicing them, sometimes fearing lower grades if they don't censor themselves. According to a 2021 survey administered by College Pulse of over 37,000 students at 159 colleges, 80 percent of students self-censor at least some of the time. Forty-eight percent of undergraduate students described themselves as "somewhat uncomfortable" or "very uncomfortable" with expressing their views on a controversial topic in the classroom. At U.Va., 57 percent of those surveyed feel that way.</p>

<p>When a class discussion goes poorly for me, I can tell. During a feminist theory class in my sophomore year, I said that non-Indian women can criticize suttee, a historical practice of ritual suicide by Indian widows. This idea seems acceptable for academic discussion, but to many of my classmates, it was objectionable.</p>

<p>The room felt tense. I saw people shift in their seats. Someone got angry, and then everyone seemed to get angry. After the professor tried to move the discussion along, I still felt uneasy. I became a little less likely to speak up again and a little less trusting of my own thoughts. I was shaken, but also determined to not silence myself. Still, the disdain of my fellow students stuck with me. I was a welcome member of the group — and then I wasn't.</p>

<p>Throughout that semester, I saw similar reactions in response to other students' ideas. I heard fewer classmates speak up. Eventually, our discussions became monotonous echo chambers. Absent rich debate and rigor, we became mired in socially safe ideas.</p>

<p>Being criticized — even strongly — during a difficult discussion does not trouble me. We need more classrooms full of energetic debate, not fewer. But when criticism transforms into a public shaming, it stifles learning.</p>

<p>Professors have noticed a shift in their classrooms. Brad Wilcox, a sociology professor here, told me that he believes that two factors have caused self-censorship's pervasiveness. "First, students are afraid of being called out on social media by their peers," he said. "Second, the dominant messages students hear from faculty, administrators and staff are progressive ones. So they feel an implicit pressure to conform to those messages in classroom and campus conversations and debates."</p>

<p>The consequences for saying something outside the norm can be steep. I met Stephen Wiecek at our debate club. He's an outgoing, formidable first-year debater who often stays after meetings to help clean up. He's also conservative. At U.Va., where only 9 percent of students surveyed described themselves as a "strong Republican" or "weak Republican," that puts him in the minority.</p>

<p>He told me that he has often "straight-up lied" about his beliefs to avoid conflict. Sometimes it's at a party, sometimes it's at an a cappella rehearsal, and sometimes it's in the classroom. When politics comes up, "I just kind of go into survival mode," he said. "I tense up a lot more, because I've got to think very carefully about how I word things. It's very anxiety inducing."</p>

<p>This anxiety affects not just conservatives. I spoke with Abby Sacks, a progressive fourth-year student. She said she experienced a "pile-on" during a class discussion about sexism in media. She disagreed with her professor, who she said called "Captain Marvel" a feminist film. Ms. Sacks commented that she felt the film emphasized the title character's physical strength instead of her internal conflict and emotions. She said this seemed to frustrate her professor.</p>

<p>Her classmates noticed. "It was just a succession of people, one after each other, each vehemently disagreeing with me," she told me.</p>

<p>Ms. Sacks felt overwhelmed. "Everyone adding on to each other kind of energized the room, like everyone wanted to be part of the group with the correct opinion," she said. The experience, she said, "made me not want to go to class again." While Ms. Sacks did continue to attend the class, she participated less frequently. She told me that she felt as if she had become invisible.</p>

<p>Other campuses also struggle with this. "Viewpoint diversity is no longer considered a sacred, core value in higher education," Samuel Abrams, a politics professor at Sarah Lawrence College, told me. He felt this firsthand. In 2018, after he wrote an Opinion essay for The Times criticizing what he viewed as a lack of ideological diversity among university administrators, his office door was vandalized.</p>

<p>Student protesters demanded his tenure be reviewed. While their attempts were unsuccessful, Dr. Abrams remains dissatisfied with fellow faculty members' reactions. In response to the incident, only 27 faculty members signed a statement supporting free expression — less than 10 percent of the college's faculty.</p>

<p>Dr. Abrams said the environment on today's campuses differs from his undergraduate experience. He recalled late-night debates with fellow students that sometimes left him feeling "hurt" but led to "the ecstasy of having my mind opened up to new ideas." He worries that self-censorship threatens this environment and argues that college administrations in particular "enforce and create a culture of obedience and fear that has chilled speech."</p>

<p>The solution to self-censorship cannot merely be to encourage students to be more courageous. Is it brave to risk your social standing by saying something unpopular? Yes. Is it reasonable to ask college students — the 48 percent of us who feel uncomfortable sharing our views — to solve this problem independently? No.</p>

<p>And believe me, I've tried.</p>

<p>I protested a university policy about the size of signs allowed on dorm room doors by mounting a large sign of the First Amendment. It was removed by the university. In response, I worked with administrators to create a less restrictive policy. As a columnist for the university paper, I implored students to embrace free expression. In response, I lost friends and faced a Twitter pile-on. I have been brave. And yet, without support, the activism of a few students like me changes little.</p>

<p>Our universities cannot change our social interactions. But they can foster appreciation for ideological diversity in academic environments. Universities must do more than make public statements supporting free expression. We need a campus culture that prioritizes ideological diversity and strong policies that protect expression in the classroom.</p>

<p>Universities should refuse to cancel controversial speakers or cave to unreasonable student demands. They should encourage professors to reward intellectual diversity and nonconformism in classroom discussions. And most urgently, they should discard restrictive speech codes and bias response teams that pathologize ideological conflict.</p>

<p>We cannot experience the full benefits of a university education without having our ideas challenged, yet challenged in ways that allow us to grow. As Ms. Sacks told me, "We need to have conversations about these issues without punishing each other for our opinions."</p>

                text: `<p>As a young gay man only a few years out of high school, I see the appeal of the Harvey Milk High School, a public school in New York City for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender students that will be expanded this fall. But it is the easy way out — an exercise in wishful thinking that will do little to foster tolerance.</p>

<p>I know that public high schools can be unfriendly and scary, especially if you are homosexual. But the purpose of high school is not just earning a diploma, but also learning how to interact with people who may be different from you. There's no way an isolated, segregated environment will teach homosexual and heterosexual students to coexist and respect each other.</p>

<p>After years of keeping silent, I decided to come out during my sophomore year in high school. I knew it wouldn't be easy, but at least I would be facing reality. My school, Schenley High School in Pittsburgh, is an inner-city public high school. It is slightly famous because Andy Warhol went there, and it's pretty liberal, but there was still the same bullying and homophobia that exist in just about every high school.</p>

<p>At first I only told a few people, but within a month the whole school knew. Much to my surprise, my life got better. I made a new set of friends among other students who considered themselves outsiders. Teachers, impressed by my courage, gave me support. My grades improved significantly (by the end of my junior year, my grade-point average went up to an A from a C). Sure, not every day was easy, but by lifting the burden of my secret, I was able to get my act together and start focusing on my future.</p>

<p>I know that not every gay high school student has such a positive experience, but I do feel that being in a school among other students who were "different" in their own way made accepting me easier. And it was great for the school. Students who had never known a gay person now knew one. And I wasn't scary to them.</p>

<p>I do think it's important for people to express their sexuality, even at a young age, and it's only fair that they should be able to do so in a safe environment. But if gay students are afraid of being called names, going to an exclusively gay high school is not going to solve their problems. The straight bullies (and the closeted gay bullies) will be able to thrive and fester in their own hateful paradise, while the gay students will sit around hating the bullies in theirs.</p>

<p>The sad truth is that gay people are discriminated against no matter what — no matter where we go to school, where we live, where we work. Segregating gay students won't prevent it. Rather than promoting unity and understanding, it will foster intolerance among both straight and gay people.</p>`

                text: `<p>"A black school? But you're so smart, you could go anywhere."</p>

<p>That was the reaction I got when I told some high school friends that I would attend Spelman, a historically black women's college in Atlanta. I know they thought they were complimenting me.</p>

<p>At first, I tried to justify my decision, pointing to the college's notable alumnae and research opportunities. But the fact that Spelman is the nation's top-ranked historically black college was lost on them. I couldn't make my peers understand the experience of a black student in an overwhelmingly white school. I couldn't convey the significance of historically black colleges and universities.</p>

<p>I wasn't interested in Spelman when I first visited. I was in the eighth grade and my heart was set on the Northeast Ivies. I knew I wanted extensive study-abroad options, a core curriculum and at least a 10 percent black student population. That last item was nonnegotiable.</p>

<p>That year during spring break, my mom took my brother and me to Atlanta to sightsee. "Your nana would want you to see this school," my mom said as we pulled up to Spelman's gate. "You don't have to go, but you are going to see it."</p>

<p>My parents' shared premium on education bonded them as graduate students at the University of Southern California in the 1990s. Two New Yorkers pursuing their master's and doctorates, they saw school as the surest way to attain security. It was never a question that I was going to college. Hard work, I was taught, would ensure as many choices as possible.</p>

<p>That level of pressure was the norm in Montgomery County, Md., just outside Washington, D.C., where I grew up. It is one of the wealthiest and best-educated counties in the country. It is also largely segregated and fiercely competitive. I grew up surrounded by so much privilege it was possible for many residents to ignore race and class inequality entirely. After all, the nation's first black president lived 12 miles away. So, despite the racial violence that was making headlines, my friends seemed to believe Montgomery County was post-racial.</p>

<p>"It's sad but it's a good thing we don't have those problems here," a classmate said the day after Trayvon Martin was murdered. It was clear to me, but not to many of my peers, that the community was still very much influenced by stereotypes and misconceptions about race. When I tried to talk to my classmates about that, they tended to be defensive.</p>

<p>Being one of the few black kids in my school was all I'd ever known before college. Having my hair teasingly prodded during recess or being called "oreo" felt normal. From 7 a.m. until 4 p.m., I learned to excuse small indignities, and I used humor as a defense mechanism. When I got home, I could finally vent to the few other people who understood. My mother was very clear: "Don't let anyone touch your hair and you better not let them call you outside of your name."</p>

<p>As I got older, I felt less and less like I belonged. When I started taking AP courses and showing up to the same college info sessions as many of my classmates, they made jokes about quotas and affirmative action, as if they hadn't seen me studying right alongside them for years. One classmate even asked me to give up my spot on the morning announcements because "I didn't need anything extra" for my college applications anyway.</p>

<p>It wasn't the comments that bothered me so much as the fact that they came from people I knew. They had seen how hard I worked to maintain an advanced course load and leadership positions.</p>

<p>My grandmother, the eighth of 13 children raised on a tobacco farm in Yanceyville, N.C., was the first of her siblings to leave home. In 1960, she graduated from Shaw University, the oldest HBCU in the South, and dissatisfied with the limited opportunities for a black woman in her Jim Crow state, moved to New York to teach. She sought to realize her best self while being seen as an individual.</p>

<p>Her daughter, my mother, sought something similar when she left her predominantly white neighborhood on Long Island, N.Y. She went to Georgetown University but took her first African-American studies courses across the city at Howard University. Even though she loved Georgetown, it was at Howard that she was finally able to learn in a context that validated her history and identity.</p>

<p>I ended up applying to nearly 20 colleges, and got into some great schools like Swarthmore, but Spelman kept pulling me back. I had never met professors or college administrators who looked like me or who seemed so genuinely interested in what I had to say. On a visit, I remember sitting in on an "African Diaspora and the World" class — a required course for freshmen on racial formation, colonization and capitalism — and not second-guessing myself before I spoke. I did not worry that the class might think my questions were "hypersensitive" or "hostile." When I was offered a full scholarship and a spot in the honors program, I accepted immediately.</p>

<p>There is something powerful about attending an institution that was built for you. Most colleges were built for white students, or at least, with only white students in mind. At Spelman, I found a place for myself in the curriculum, and an opening to learn what it means to be me.</p>`

                text: `<p>The phrase "spring break" conjures up images of college students lounging on beaches by day and hitting the clubs at night. Many students do, in fact, travel from campus to far-flung places. On the assumption that most students leave, schools generally shut down.</p>

<p>But this assumption is outdated, especially as colleges enroll a greater number of academically talented students from poor families.</p>

<p>I met Valeria, an engaging sociology major from the Midwest, while conducting a study on social class at elite colleges that included white, black, Latino and Asian students. (Valeria is not her real name; the terms of my research protocol require that I use pseudonyms for all students.) In our conversations, she described one aspect of how it felt to be a poor student on a rich campus: "There's always famine during spring break."</p>

<p>This problem is more complicated and widespread than people realize. Data I collected in 2016 on colleges that have adopted no-loan financial aid policies, which is one way of measuring a school's commitment to lower-income students, reveal that roughly one in four kept their cafeterias open during spring break the same way they do when classes are in session. At Harvard, where I teach, it was not until 2015 that the administration opened the dining halls during the break (a project I was involved in).</p>

<p>Some colleges, like Smith and Carleton, charge students additional fees to stay on campus during this period. Now, a daily rate of $10 or $15 might not seem like much to some. But to many lower-income students, it is substantial.</p>

<p>Spring break is a luxury that many students can't afford. In a sense, though, it is one that many colleges make them buy anyway.</p>

<p>I faced this reality as a student at Amherst in the mid-2000s. Valentine Hall, our only cafeteria, closed. I could not afford to go home to Miami, the choice destination for many of my peers. Instead, I foraged through campus job postings to pick up extra shifts to pay off meals I put on my credit card.</p>

<p>Today's students face a similar fate. With no access to a kitchen in which to cook or store food, Michael, a slim, reserved first-generation college student, told me, "I just go to Family Dollar to buy things that I can microwave." Many students I spoke to rationed food they took from the cafeteria, oftentimes with the help of sympathetic cafeteria workers.</p>

<p>Spencer, the daughter of refugees, recounted how she "stole food the day before they closed everything — I took a bunch of bread and things that are not perishable." Michelle, reflective and thoughtful, imported a strategy she used when she and her family were homeless in New York: She found a soup kitchen near campus. With comedic seriousness, Arianna, who has a Southern California vibe, told me, "Spring break is the real 'Hunger Games.'"</p>

<p>Colleges are not unaware of what cafeteria closings can do to students. Some make special concessions for athletes, international students and those with certain campus jobs. Lower-income students are often not one of these protected classes. This institutional oversight brings about real pain. Worse, the strategies students adopt in response amplify their sense of isolation and difference. Miranda, her words heavy with emotion, yelled: "We don't have a kitchen. It's really frustrating. What the hell are we supposed to do?"</p>

<p>At the 2016 IvyG conference, where first-generation college students from the Ivy League came together, Molly, a woman with a pixie haircut, stood up in a room of 200 people to discuss the realities of being a poor college student. After pausing for just a moment, she revealed how she made ends meet during spring break: She increased her online dating activity to secure meals. Banking on men paying for the first date, she felt that her best option was to use Tinder as if it were OpenTable.</p>

<p>At elite colleges like Harvard, food insecurity — not knowing where your next meal is coming from — is more episodic, happening mostly around breaks. That is not the case at many other colleges around the country. At the University of Hawaii at Manoa, public health researchers found in 2009 that 21 percent students there experienced this reality firsthand. A more recent George Washington University survey revealed that one in five first-generation college students reported being "food insecure" three or more times a week. In a study done by California State University, college officials estimated that 21 percent of their students struggled with food insecurity. The reality is that students at state and community colleges bear this burden most acutely.</p>

<p>Food insecurity undercuts academic performance. But its effects go beyond lowering grades. Hunger in the midst of plenty weakens students' sense of belonging and undercuts their social, emotional and physical well-being. Knowing one's peers are away relaxing while you scrounge for food makes poor students not only keenly aware of their own economic disadvantage but also of what their colleges make them endure because of it.</p>

<p>Some colleges are reversing their decision to close cafeterias. Amherst now opens Valentine Hall during break. Connecticut College, which in 2015 charged fees to eat and stay on campus, no longer does for breaks in the academic year. Through valiant efforts by student activists, other colleges have opened food banks. Virginia Commonwealth University (in 2014) and George Washington University (in 2016) opened pantries to provide students with healthy food options. Columbia opened a food bank last year. We need more changes like these on individual campuses. But for systemic change, more robust interventions are needed.</p>

<p>Battling food insecurity in college calls for national policy changes. Increases to federal Pell Grants would provide students with resources for expenses associated with being in college, those covered by tuition and the many incidentals that are not. Expanding college students' eligibility for SNAP is equally important. These changes would allow students to focus energy and time on academics instead of strategizing about ways to secure food. Given the present presidential administration, however, I am not optimistic that reducing such inequalities will become a priority anytime soon.</p>

<p>To borrow from the actress Viola Davis, diversity "is not a hashtag" to be celebrated when recruiting poor students and put on the back burner once they are on campus. It is one thing to extend coveted invitations to them. It's another to really prepare for their arrival.</p>

                text: `<p>Many people envy my status as a freshman at Yale College. My classmates and I made it through some fierce competition, and we are excited to have been accepted to one of the best academic and extracurricular programs in American higher education. I have an older brother who attended Yale, and I've heard from him what life at Yale is like.</p>

<p>He spent all his college years living at home because our parents are New Haven residents, and Yale's rules then did not require him to live in the dorms. But Yale's new regulations demand that I spend my freshman and sophomore years living in the college dormitories.</p>

<p>I, two other freshmen and two sophomores have refused to do this because life in the dorms, even on the floors Yale calls "single sex," is contrary to the fundamental principles we have been taught as long as we can remember — the principles of Judaism lived according to the Torah and 3,000-year-old rabbinic teachings. Unless Yale waives its residence requirement, we may have no choice but to sue the university to protect our religious way of life.</p>

<p>Bingham Hall, on the Yale quadrangle known as the Old Campus, is one of the dorms for incoming students. When I entered it two weeks ago during an orientation tour, I literally saw the handwriting on the wall. A sign titled "Safe Sex" told me where to pick up condoms on campus. Another sign touted 100 ways to make love without having sex, like "take a nap together" and "take a steamy shower together."</p>

<p>That, I am told, is real life in the dorms. The "freshperson" issue of The Yale Daily News sent to entering students contained a "Yale lexicon" defining "sexile" as "banishment from your dorm room because your roommate is having more fun than you." If you live in the dorms, you're expected to be part of the crowd, to accept these standards as the framework for your life.</p>

<p>Can we stand up to classmates whose sexual morality differs from ours? We've had years of rigorous religious teaching, and we've watched and learned from our parents. We can hold our own in the intellectual debate that flows naturally from exchanges during and after class. But I'm upset and hurt by this requirement that I live in the dorms. Why is Yale — an institution that professes to be so tolerant and open-minded — making it particularly hard for students like us to maintain our moral standards through difficult college years?</p>

<p>We are not trying to impose our moral standards on our classmates or on Yale. Our parents tell us that things were very different in college dormitories in their day and that in most colleges in the 1950's students who allowed guests of the opposite sex into their dorm rooms were subject to expulsion. We acknowledge that today's morality is not that of the 50's. We are asking only that Yale give us the same permission to live off campus that it gives any lower classman who is married or at least 21 years old.</p>

<p>Yale is proud of the fact that it has no "parietal rules" and that sexual morality is a student's own business. Maybe this is what Dean Richard H. Brodhead meant when he said that "Yale's residential colleges carry . . . a moral meaning." That moral meaning is, basically, "Anything goes." This morality is Yale's own residential religion, which it is proselytizing by force of its regulations.</p>

<p>We cannot, in good conscience, live in a place where women are permitted to stay overnight in men's rooms, and where visiting men can traipse through the common halls on the women's floors — in various stages of undress — in the middle of the night. The dormitories on Yale's Old Campus have floors designated by gender, but there is easy access through open stairwells from one floor to the next.</p>

<p>The moral message Yale's residences convey today is not one that our religion accepts. Nor is it a moral environment in which the five of us can spend our nights, or a moral surrounding that we can call home.</p>

<p>Yale sent me a glossy brochure when it welcomed me as an entering student. It said, "Yale retains a deep respect for its early history and for the continuity that its history provides — a continuity based on constant reflection and reappraisal." Yale ought to reflect on and reappraise a policy that compels us to compromise our religious principles.</p>`

                text: `<p>I didn't get the University of Chicago welcome letter that made the rounds on the internet earlier this summer. I'm a senior this year, and the message from Jay Ellison, the dean of undergraduate students, was for the incoming class: Don't expect trigger warnings or safe spaces here. The university, he said, was committed to free expression and would not shield students from ideas they disagreed with or found offensive.</p>

<p>The implication was that students who support trigger warnings and safe spaces are narrow-minded, oversensitive and opposed to dialogue. The letter betrayed a fundamental misunderstanding of what the terms "trigger warnings" and "safe spaces" mean, and came across as an embarrassing attempt to deflect attention from serious issues on campus.</p>

<p>A trigger warning is pretty simple: It consists of a professor's saying in class, "The reading for this week includes a graphic description of sexual assault," or a note on a syllabus that reads, "This course deals with sensitive material that may be difficult for some students."</p>

<p>A safe space is an area on campus where students — especially but not limited to those who have endured trauma or feel marginalized — can feel comfortable talking about their experiences. This might be the Office of Multicultural Student Affairs or it could be Hillel House, but in essence, it's a place for support and community.</p>

<p>This spring, I was in a seminar that dealt with gender, sexuality and disability. Some of the course reading touched on disturbing subjects, including sexual violence and child abuse. The instructor told us that we could reach out to her if we had difficulty with the class materials, and that she'd do everything she could to make it easier for us to participate. She included a statement to this effect on the syllabus and repeated it briefly at the beginning of each class. Nobody sought to "retreat from ideas and perspectives at odds with their own," as Dean Ellison put it in the letter, nor did these measures hinder discussion or disagreement, both of which were abundant.</p>

<p>Of course, not every class calls out for trigger warnings — I've never heard of them for an economics course. Likewise, plenty of students will never need to visit a safe space. But for those who do, support systems can be a lifeline in the tumultuous environment of college, and are important precisely because they encourage a free exchange of ideas.</p>

<p>A little heads-up can help students engage with uncomfortable and complex topics, and a little sensitivity to others, at the most basic level, isn't coddling. Civic discourse in this country has become pretty ugly, so maybe it's not surprising that students are trying to create ways to have compassionate, civil dialogue.</p>

<p>The really strange thing about the Ellison letter, though, is that it positioned itself in opposition to resources the University of Chicago has already built: Instructors already choose whether to use trigger warnings in their classes, and there are many safe spaces on campus. Dean Ellison is even listed as a "safe space ally" on the website of one program run by the Office of L.G.B.T.Q. Student Life.</p>

<p>If, as a university spokesman says, no program or policy is set to change, why release this condemnation at all?</p>

<p>The administration wants to appear as an intellectual force beating back destabilizing waves of political correctness that have rocked college campuses. But the focus of student protests hasn't been the lack of trigger warnings and safe spaces. Instead, many protesters want the university to evaluate how it invests its money, improve access for students with mental illnesses and disabilities, support low-income and first-generation students, and pay its employees fair wages. They have been pushing for more transparency in the school's private police force, which has resisted making most of its policies public in the face of complaints. The university is also under federal investigation over its handling of sexual assault cases.</p>

<p>Yet, the administration has refused to meet with student groups who have asked to discuss these issues, and it has threatened to discipline students who staged a sit-in protest. The university even hired a provost who specializes in corporate crisis management and dealing with "activist pressure." While the university accuses students of silencing opposing voices, it continues to insulate itself against difficult questions.</p>

<p>In this context, it's hard to see the dean's letter as anything other than a public relations maneuver. While students are being depicted as coddled and fragile, the administration is stacking bricks in its institutional wall to avoid engaging with their real concerns.</p>

<p>It's too bad, because there are certainly legitimate debates to be had over speech in academic settings. The Ellison letter, for example, included a denunciation of attempts by students to disrupt university-sponsored events featuring controversial speakers. But that has little to do with trigger warnings and safe spaces.</p>

<p>Regardless of the posturing of academic administrations, in trigger warnings and safe spaces, students have carved out ways to help, accommodate and listen to those around them. Campus advocacy groups will not be deterred by a letter, as their goals have nothing to do with censorship and everything to do with holding universities accountable to the communities they are supposed to foster.</p>

                text: `<p>Talking out of turn. Destroying classroom materials. Disrespecting teachers. Blurting out answers during tests. Students pushing, kicking, hitting one another and even rolling on the ground. This is what happens in my school every single day.</p>

<p>You may think I'm joking, but I swear I'm not.</p>

<p>Based on my peers' behavior, you might guess that I'm in second or fourth grade. But I'm actually about to enter high school in New York City, and, during my three years of middle school, these sorts of disruptions occurred repeatedly in any given 42-minute class period.</p>

<p>That's why I'm in favor of the distance learning the New York City school system instituted when the coronavirus pandemic hit. If our schools use this experience to understand how to better support teachers in the classroom, then students will have a shot at learning more effectively when we return.</p>

<p>Let me explain why.</p>

<p>I have been doing distance learning since March 23 and find that I am learning more, and with greater ease, than when I attended regular classes. I can work at my own pace without being interrupted by disruptive students and teachers who seem unable to manage them.</p>

<p>Students unable or unwilling to control themselves steal valuable class time, often preventing their classmates from being prepared for tests and assessments. I have taken tests that included entire topics we never mastered, either because we were not able to get through the lesson or we couldn't sufficiently focus.</p>

<p>I do not envy a middle-school teacher's job. It's far from easy to oversee 26 teenagers. And in my three years of middle school, I've encountered only a few teachers who had strong command of their classrooms — enforcing consistent rules, treating students fairly and earning their respect.</p>

<p>I go to a school that puts a big emphasis on collaborative learning; approximately 80 percent of our work is done in teacher-assigned groups of three to five students. This forces students who want to complete their assignments into the position of having to discipline peers who won't behave and coax reluctant group members into contributing.</p>

<p>Distance learning gives me more control of my studies. I can focus more time on subjects that require greater effort and study. I don't have to sit through a teacher fielding questions that have already been answered. I can still collaborate with other students, but much more effectively. I am really enjoying FaceTiming friends who bring different perspectives and strengths to the work; we challenge one another and it's a richer learning experience.</p>

<p>I've also found that I prefer some of the recorded lessons that my teachers post to Google Classroom over the lessons they taught in person. This year I have struggled with math. The teacher rarely had the patience for questions as he spent at least a third of class time trying to maintain order. Often, when I scheduled time to meet with him before school, there would be a pileup at his door of students who also had questions. He couldn't help us all in 20 minutes before first period. Other times he just wouldn't show up.</p>

<p>With distance learning, all of that wasted time is eliminated. I stop, start and even rewind the teacher's recording when I need to and am able to understand the lesson on the day it's taught. If I am confused, I attend my teacher's weekly online office hours (which are 60-90 minutes long); there are never more than two or three other students present.</p>

<p>The fact that I am learning so much better away from the classroom shows that something is wrong with our system. Two weeks ago, my school began experimenting with live video teaching on Google Meet. Unfortunately, the same teachers who struggle to manage students in the classroom also struggle online.</p>

<p>What lessons from remote learning can be taken back to the classroom? I have a few suggestions. First, teachers should send recorded video lessons to all students after class (through email or online platforms like Google Classroom). Second, teachers should offer students consistent, weekly office hours of ample time for 1-to-1 or small group meetings. Third, teachers who are highly skilled in classroom management should be paid more to lead required trainings for teachers, plus reinforcement sessions as needed.</p>

<p>These first two suggestions began during distance learning and have already been a great success. I hope they continue when we return to school, and that schools use this opportunity to improve the learning experiences of all their students.</p>

I was at a festive Shabbat dinner with other undergraduates at Yeshiva University, a few months into my freshman year at its Stern College for Women. "He's a fag," I overheard a student in a spiffy suit say to the woman seated next to him.</p>

<p>A year earlier, as a senior at an all-girls Hasidic high school in Brooklyn in 2016, I had looked forward to being surrounded by open-minded, religiously committed Jews at the renowned Modern Orthodox university in New York City. But in that moment, my fantasies crumbled.</p>

<p>As the slur echoed in my mind, glasses clinked, cheerful conversations continued, and the only visible concern in the room was mine. It was my first encounter with casual bigotry at Yeshiva, but not my last.</p>

<p>Over the next four years, I would face ridicule and bullying as a bisexual and nonbinary person advocating for the queer community at Yeshiva. The discrimination wasn't just from fellow students: Administrators denied us the right to form a recognized L.G.B.T.Q. student group and failed to meaningfully address discrimination by rabbis, students and teachers at the school, actions that effectively encouraged queer students to stay in the closet or leave the university. (In response to a request for comment on these and other allegations, a representative for Yeshiva said there were "factual inaccuracies" but declined to say what they were, and offered no further statement.)</p>

<p>I graduated in January 2021 and in April, I was part of a group of alumni and current students who filed a lawsuit against Yeshiva in New York County Supreme Court. We believe that Y.U. violated the New York City Human Rights Law by denying us the right to form an official L.G.B.T.Q. student group.</p>

<p>I was born and raised in an ultra-Orthodox community in Borough Park, Brooklyn, that adheres to the traditions of pre-Holocaust European Jews. While I did not find the courage to accept my bisexuality until college, the feeling of difference was all-encompassing, even as a young teen. I thought I needed to choose: I could be Jewish or different, Jewish or a feminist, Jewish or happy.</p>

<p>Yeshiva, considered by many the premier Modern Orthodox educational institution, seemed to promise an Orthodox Judaism that offers the best of both worlds. The university's guiding principle, as well as the de facto motto of the Modern Orthodox movement, is Torah Umadda, loosely translated "Torah and general knowledge," which asserts that Jewishness and Jewish faith can exist alongside, and even be enhanced by, secular concerns.</p>

<p>When I first arrived at Yeshiva, I knew that by coming out, I would brand myself as an outlier. There were only a handful of out queer people on campus. There was little visible queer community and no designated space for us to gather. It didn't take me long to feel that was by design.</p>

<p>For years, undergraduate student advocates have petitioned the school's administration to approve a club for queer people and allies. Y.U. has repeatedly stalled, hedged and refused. In 2020 the university released a statement noting that "the message of the Torah on this issue" of L.G.B.T.Q. identity is "nuanced" and that the formation of an L.G.B.T.Q. club "under the auspices of Y.U. will cloud this nuanced message."</p>

<p>It is true that large swaths of the Modern Orthodox world, which adheres to many traditional interpretations of Jewish law, have repudiated the L.G.B.T.Q. community. But the world is changing. Being queer is increasingly recognized as a fundamental, immutable, and integral part of who many people — including religious Jews — are.</p>

<p>Across the Orthodox world, there have been signs that this recognition is beginning to sink in. In 2010, the organization Eshel was founded with the goal of creating community and acceptance for lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender Jews and their families in Orthodox communities. In 2019, Daniel Atwood became the first openly gay man to be ordained an Orthodox rabbi.</p>

<p>I have come to understand that queerness and Judaism are not antithetical to one another. Queer Jews are as old as the Torah itself. There are only two anti-queer passages in Leviticus, and there are many more passages in the Hebrew Bible and the Talmud that positively or neutrally revolve around queerness, including what some read as the love story between David and Jonathan, and the detailed recognition and description of intersex people in the Talmud.</p>

<p>And despite what those on Judaism's religious right may claim, our communities have always evolved and adapted to the times, which is why Yeshiva proudly educates women in Torah scholarship, even though traditional religious sources are divided about the permissibility of it.</p>

<p>I hope that our lawsuit is successful, but whatever the outcome, this will not be the end of the fight for L.G.B.T.Q. acceptance at Yeshiva or in Modern Orthodoxy. If the university administration finds the courage to live up to its own ideals, the rest of the community will follow.</p>

                text: `<p>This month my father and I drove to the United States Citizenship and Immigration Services office in Centennial, Colo., for a routine visit. I offered to drive because my dad was too nervous and excited to take the wheel. "How long have we waited for this day?" he asked me. He had been told to come in for a final interview before he could get approved for legal permanent residency.</p>

<p>But the meeting turned into a nightmare. Several hours after we arrived, I found myself alone, in disbelief. My dad had been detained and was facing deportation proceedings.</p>

<p>My father is undocumented but has lived in the United States since 1998. He has raised four children, all American citizens, on income from construction work. He pays his taxes and plays by the rules. He himself has been a perfect citizen — although, of course, he can't call himself that.</p>

<p>Regardless of his status, he has earned the right to work hard without the constant anxiety of being apprehended. His children — of whom I am the oldest — deserve that peace of mind too.</p>

<p>Most people can't wait to turn 21 so that they can drink. For me, it was the day I could finally petition the government to change my dad's immigration status. I filed the paperwork in February and believed it would be the beginning of sleeping easier at night, of not worrying about "la migra" every time the phone rang.</p>

<p>Eight months later, my father and I showed up at the immigration services office with our lawyer and notebooks full of supporting documents. The officer told us our petition should be approved, but not that day. We took this as an indication of another waiting period, but we remained upbeat: The officer told my father how to learn about his rights as a lawful permanent resident and acknowledged that he had paid the appropriate fees.</p>

<p>After the officer left the room several times, something changed in her demeanor, and the air in the room became thick with mounting uncertainty. She asked me to leave. I didn't want to, so she turned to my father and asked him to tell me to leave. I told myself I was just being paranoid and walked outside. As I waited, three Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents came in and took custody of my dad.</p>

<p>When our lawyer reappeared, the look on his face told me everything I needed to know. The world felt ripped from under my feet.</p>

<p>My dad wanted to follow the rules. He has been trying to adjust his status with the help of relatives since 2001. We filed the correct paperwork, paid the fees and lined up all his references, only for my dad to be dragged out of a little office and locked up. ICE could have chosen to grant my dad his residency, per the suggestion of our immigration officer. Instead, my father, a man who has filed his taxes every year, has no criminal record and is the sole provider for four children, wasn't even put out on monitor or bond. He is still being held in a detention center in Aurora, Colo., and is awaiting deportation proceedings unless ICE grants him the cancellation of his removal.</p>

<p>It feels like a sick joke that at Yale University, where I'm a senior, I am majoring in ethnicity, race and migration. I have spent hours discussing, studying and reimagining fairer immigration policies. But none of that, none of my hard work, is good enough. It won't release my dad.</p>

<p>What happened to him is not an appropriate application of the law — it is cruelty. It's not just my dad's story. Under President Trump, every undocumented person living in the United States is a target, a deportation priority. This is a grave national security mistake. As this administration creates more distrust and fear in our communities, it is not encouraging people to be honest with law enforcement agents. Undocumented people want to cooperate with the law, but there is no path for them to do so without jeopardy of detainment or removal.</p>

<p>So many families like mine are threatened by a deeply flawed immigration system in the United States, which is basically enforced in an ad hoc manner. If upholding the law is important, pulling families apart is no way to do it.</p>

                text: `<p>It was my first year as a public policy graduate student at the University of Texas, Dallas, and I was taking all my classes at night so I could work during the day. Every evening, after class got out around 10, I had to walk through the sprawling parking lots to get to my car. I dreaded that time of day. I would pray that no one was lurking in dimly lit areas or behind cars, and I'd try not to think about the campus police alerts I'd seen about sexual assaults in the area.</p>

<p>I had survived such an assault myself when I was a child. The incident left me acutely aware of the realities of being preyed upon just because you are physically smaller and less likely to protect yourself. I know what it means to feel defenseless.</p>

<p>Now my only means of protection was a rape whistle. I would hold it in one hand and my phone in the other, the numbers 9-1-1 pre-dialed and my finger on the call button. As I neared my car, I would start to jog. It scared me to think that even if I dialed the number and blew the whistle, by the time anyone got to the scene it might be too late. When I got to my car, I'd get in, lock the doors and look behind me to make sure no one was in the back seat.</p>

<p>This was in 2015, around the time the Texas Legislature began debating, and ultimately passing, a so-called campus carry bill. I grew up in a Democratic, immigrant household in a suburb outside of Dallas, where guns and gun policy were never discussed, so I hadn't paid much attention when similar bills failed in 2011 and 2013. But that year something changed. I was 25 years old, commuting alone, and as a minority woman, I felt particularly vulnerable.</p>

<p>I started fighting for students' rights to carry concealed weapons for selfish reasons: I wanted to be able to protect myself. But I quickly found a network of women who felt the same way I did, and we began to advocate for our safety together. I eventually became the Southwest director of Students for Concealed Carry, and am now the founder of the self-defense nonprofit Empowered, which will open its first chapter this fall, at the University of North Texas. (I have also appeared in ads for the National Rifle Association, but I am not employed by the organization.)</p>

<p>When I started advocating for concealed carry on campus, I was not a "gun enthusiast" or a member of any Second Amendment organizations. I had only recently been taught to shoot by a concerned local firearms instructor who had heard about a scare I had with a cyberstalker.</p>

<p>But from the minute I put my hands around a Ruger LC9 pistol, the gun I regularly carry with me now, I felt more in control. I felt empowered to be holding a tool that could protect me physically, and I was determined to learn how to use it responsibly. It was a relief to know that I could shoot if I had to, even though I would never use my gun unless it was a last means of self-defense. I got my concealed carry license a year ago.</p>

<p>In addition to Texas, Arkansas, Colorado, Georgia, Idaho, Kansas, Mississippi, Oregon, Utah and Wisconsin all now allow students with concealed carry permits to carry guns inside the buildings of college campuses. I have learned that there are a lot of misconceptions about these bills. In Texas, only concealed handgun license holders who are 21 years old or older can carry firearms on campus. The rule applies only to public schools, and those schools can also set aside gun-free zones in whatever locations they choose.</p>

<p>Still, I regularly encounter liberals who fear irresponsible gun use and think that college kids (even if they are 21) can't be trusted with firearms. I understand that fear is a powerful motivator on both sides of this issue. But I fiercely resent being told that I can't protect myself according to my rights as an American.</p>

<p>The Justice Department estimates that one in five women are assaulted during college. This number does not surprise me, although plenty of my fellow conservatives take issue with it. I have met so many women through my gun advocacy who felt helpless in the face of sexual assault before they carried a weapon — they felt that no one would listen to them, that they didn't have any options. It is a huge failing of the conservative movement not to take this seriously. Even if the one out of five statistic is imprecise, isn't one assaulted woman bad enough?</p>

<p>Female gun ownership isn't a matter of political affiliation. I've met women across the political spectrum who own guns for self-defense or for shooting recreationally. In particular, black women have become a lot more interested in gun ownership and shooting classes.</p>

<p>The rights and values of gun-owning women aren't being addressed by either political party. While conservatives aren't paying enough attention to sexual assault, liberals are actively hurting women's access to self-defense. Many liberals — including many female professors my organization approached as potential sponsors for Empowered — don't support a woman's "right to choose" when it comes to her own self-defense. They can't get behind a vision of female empowerment that doesn't match their own.</p>

<p>Contrary to popular belief, there is a place for young, pro-Second Amendment women in modern feminism. And there is a place for them on college campuses.</p>

                text: `<p>Last October, I attended a high school Halloween party. A group of guys from my school surrounded me and shouted homophobic slurs. One even threatened me with physical violence. When I broke down crying in class the next day, my teacher comforted me. She told me that she had gone through something similar when she was my age.</p>

<p>On Tuesday, the Florida Senate approved the Parental Rights in Education bill, also known as the Don't Say Gay bill. The bill, which Gov. Ron DeSantis has said he will sign, seeks to ban public schools in the state from teaching about sexual orientation or gender identity from kindergarten through the third grade, or through the 12th grade in a manner deemed "age-inappropriate" by parents. Had the proposed law been in effect last year, my teacher could have put herself in jeopardy by being there for me.</p>

<p>From an early age I knew I was different. I wasn't interested in the things other boys my age did, and I didn't really feel comfortable in the clothes my parents bought me. The struggle for acceptance was not just internal, it also felt as if my classmates didn't know what to make of me. By fourth grade I was convinced that I was broken. I didn't know how to defend myself when other kids made hateful comments or bullied me — I didn't know why I was the way that I was. Without the vocabulary to articulate why I felt and acted like this, I assumed what they said about me was true. For most of the kids in my grade, I was the only kid like me they knew.</p>

<p>My life changed the summer before seventh grade. A girl at an arts summer camp turned to me on the first day and asked, "Are you L.G.B.T.Q.?" She explained what each letter meant and showed me pictures of RuPaul on her phone. It felt as if a weight had been taken off my shoulders. The realization that I wasn't the only one saved my life. I remember stepping away and calling my best friend at the time: "Max, I think I am gay."</p>

<p>When I came home from camp, I became fascinated with learning more about queer culture. I read about Georgia Black, a Black trans woman who lived close to where I do now in the early 1900s, and I learned that in pre-Colonial times, more than 150 Indigenous tribes acknowledged third genders in their community and three to five gender roles: female, male, Two Spirit female, Two Spirit male and transgender. I realized how common the experience of falling outside of the gender binary was. As I learned about the history and culture of my community, I grew to understand and love myself. Education made me hate myself less.</p>

<p>I have come to realize that those who have been so openly hateful toward me often knew little about the queer community — they thought being L.G.B.T.Q. was a conscious choice. Education didn't just give me a sense of self worth but also the knowledge of a community and lifeline there for countless young people.</p>

<p>L.G.B.T.Q. teenagers are four times as likely to attempt suicide as their straight counterparts. According to the Trevor Project, a crisis intervention and suicide prevention organization for young gay, lesbian, bisexual, transgender and queer people, teenagers who learned about L.G.B.T.Q. issues or people in school were 23 percent less likely to attempt suicide. We have a mental health crisis in the queer community, and Governor DeSantis and the Republican Party want to outlaw the solution.</p>

<p>I am lucky to have supportive parents, but I am in the minority among my peers. Research has shown that L.G.B.T.Q. teenagers have a higher risk of experiencing some form of homelessness, with family conflict being the primary cause. Many of my close friends have been thrown out of their homes after coming out to their parents or being outed by others. One of my best friends even stayed with my family for three weeks after he was kicked out of his home because his parents refused to accept that he was trans. Other friends have told me disturbing stories of being physically abused or worse because they strayed from traditional gender norms.</p>

<p>On Feb. 28, I spoke out against the bill on the Florida Senate floor, and on Monday my friend Maddi Zornek and I led a walkout of more than 500 students at our high school. Republican lawmakers have been echoing the idea that parents know what is best for their kids, not the schools. In some cases that may be true. But parents aren't trained professionals; unlike schools, they aren't made to follow a set of standards. For many of my friends in dangerous situations because of their sexuality or gender identity, school has been a space where they could be themselves.</p>

<p>Now, under threat of lawsuits, districts, schools and teachers may be hesitant to talk at all with students about gender identity and sexuality, even if the conversation is "age-appropriate." The bill also allows the state commissioner of education to establish a "special magistrate" so that prosecuting those in violation of the law would happen much faster than in a normal court.</p>

<p>When I look back to elementary school, I wonder how different my childhood would have been had my classmates and I known that I wasn't some tragic anomaly, a strange fluke that needed to be fixed. People in support of the bill always ask, "Why do these subjects need to be taught in schools?" To them I would say that if we understand ourselves, and those around us understand us, so many lives will be saved.</p>

                text: `<p>In the not-so-distant past, the Typical College Republican idolized Ronald Reagan, fretted about the national debt and read Edmund Burke. Political sophistication, to that person, implied belief in the status quo.</p>

<p>For that bygone breed, an education at an elite institution was a moderating finishing school. Even then American universities skewed liberal, but the conservatives of old had real opportunities to make their case — and have their ideas respectfully challenged — in the public square. At my own school, Princeton, I've been told, politics were mostly separable from personal relationships.</p>

<p>How things have changed.</p>

<p>Today's campus conservatives embrace a less moderate, complacent and institutional approach to politics. Instead of belief in the status quo, many tend toward scorched-earth politics. But these changes aren't solely the consequence of a fractured national politics.</p>

<p>They're also the result of puritanically progressive campuses that alienate conservative students from their liberal peers and college as a whole. The distrust of authority, the protest and the disobedience that have characterized the left's activism over the past half-century or so have arrived on the right. The American universities that once served as moderating finishing schools have become breeding grounds for conservative firebrands.</p>

<p>The story of this transformation, according to the social psychologist Jonathan Haidt, starts around 2014, when Gen Z arrived on campus. The new progressive students were less tolerant of heterodox ideas and individuals. Demands to rescind invitations to speakers seemed to spike. The terms "microaggression" and "trigger warning" made it into everyday campus parlance. At Yale, for instance, a lecturer's suggestion that students should determine which Halloween costumes are acceptable for themselves ignited a firestorm.</p>

<p>These changes were felt on my campus, too. "Princeton has become a much more politicized place over the last 10 years," said Thomas Kelly, a philosophy professor. It's also become more progressive. Diversity training sessions blatantly endorse progressive ideas: Espousing a colorblind ideal, for example, is deemed a "microinvalidation." Bureaucrats police conduct and speech. Many programs cater to left-wing causes.</p>

<p>For those on the right, the experience is alienating. The typical American's views on gender ideology or American history are often irrelevant to his or her day-to-day life. But for the conservative college student, life is punctuated by political checkpoints. Classes may begin with requests for "preferred pronouns" or "land acknowledgments." A student who jokes about the wrong subject might face social punishment. All students should welcome challenges to their most cherished beliefs, but from what I've seen on campus, students are not invited to debate; they are expected to conform.</p>

<p>And those who challenge liberal pieties can face real repercussions. Because a Princeton student defended an unpopular opinion about policing in a private conversation, she was pushed out of her leadership position on a sports team. At Stanford, students who experience "harm" because of "who they are and how they show up in the world" can anonymously report classmates to the university, a policy that some faculty members say threatens free speech.</p>

<p>Sometimes young conservative agitators are dismissed, cynically, as attention seekers or opportunists. But in my experience, the negative consequences of conservative activism on campus, both personal and professional, far outweigh any benefit that they might incur. And, tellingly, most conservatives report censoring themselves during their college years.</p>

<p>Some might think that this pervasive progressivism would encourage conservative students to change their views. But in fact it has the opposite effect. Graduates of schools like Loyola University Chicago, George Washington University and Mount Holyoke have described how the rampant leftism on their campuses pushed them to the right. A 2017 article in The Washington Examiner quotes a Furman University graduate saying that "the aggressive leftist culture on campus made me a more radical conservative because I only had two options: abandon my beliefs and conform, or fight back." She chose to fight back.</p>

<p>The political journey of Rebekah Adams, a friend and recent graduate, is illustrative. She arrived at Princeton as a self-described moderate. Rebekah, the daughter of a Black Guyanese immigrant father, became frustrated by conversations about race on campus. "I couldn't bring nuance to the conversation about police brutality," she told me.</p>

<p>Rebekah says she faced backlash from classmates because of her views and eventually embraced a conservative political identity. She began writing for The Princeton Tory, a journal of conservative thought, on hot-button issues like Israel and started campaigning for free speech on campus. She described a process of "learning how to think for myself."</p>

<p>At a certain point, Rebekah said, she "lost faith" in Princeton, and her politics evolved further right. She publicly questioned the efficacy of Covid policies, and called diversity, equity and inclusion initiatives a "show." By October 2020, she was writing in support of Donald Trump.</p>

<p>Mr. Trump and Ron DeSantis are different kinds of politicians from John McCain and Mitt Romney. To be sure, top universities have produced outspoken conservatives like Ted Cruz and Josh Hawley. But now formative years at elite institutions that have gone woke are convincing right-leaning students and heterodox thinkers that society's most august institutions — from media outlets to universities — are fundamentally broken and need to be set on a different path. If colleges don't want to produce a new generation of conservative firebrands, they need to pump the brakes on campus progressivism. Campuses that are more welcoming to conservatives are in universities' own interest.</p>

                text: `<p>When I pictured myself in college, I envisioned potluck picnics and late nights listening to Taylor Swift, overanalyzing class crushes. Maybe even joining a Quidditch team.</p>

<p>I never daydreamed about hiding in the library bathroom, crying because I had just been rejected by an undergraduate law journal.</p>

<p>The recently publicized tensions on college campuses, particularly those in the heavily scrutinized Ivy League, are among many forces at play for students today. But there's another that has not yet captivated the news cycle.</p>

<p>It's called pre-professional pressure: a prevailing culture that convinces many of us that only careers in fields such as computer programming, finance and consulting, preferably at blue-chip firms like Goldman Sachs, McKinsey or big tech companies, can secure us worthwhile futures. It is an inescapable part of the current college experience, like tailgating or surviving on stale dining hall food. It not only steers our life choices; it also permeates daily life and negatively affects our mental health.</p>

<p>This pressure is hardly exclusive to Ivy League students. In the 2022-23 academic year, 112,270 students majored in computer science, more than double the number nine years earlier. In the 2021-22 academic year, undergraduate institutions handed out 375,400 business degrees. Unsurprisingly, the number of students pursuing humanities has declined dramatically.</p>

<p>Last year, 315,126 undergraduates applied for the 2,700 available undergraduate intern positions at Goldman Sachs.</p>

<p>Beyond the right major, the not-so-secret formula for the perfect résumé demands participation in a relevant extracurricular activity, which explains the competitive process at some selective schools for joining pre-professional clubs.</p>

<p>The interview process for Cornell's Undergraduate Asia Business Society includes entering a pitch-black lecture hall, having a projector light shone in one's face and yelling responses to questions. Getting into Yale isn't enough: Its investing club turned away 236 applicants in 2022.</p>

<p>Once one snags a spot in a club, it's straight to LinkedIn. Nearly 20 percent of people on the site are between the ages of 18 to 24, making the platform an incubator of young adult FOMO. There, we stress over whether our headshots look too high school (at the age of 18) and race to the coveted over-500-connections designation.</p>

<p>When I doom-scrolled LinkedIn, I wished I was like my classmates, posting about their prestigious internships and gathering validating likes and comments. Unfortunately, I knew my state government internship was a scarlet letter of inadequacy. My classmates seemed to think the world comprised investment bankers, management consultants — and everyone else.</p>

<p>When I first got to the University of Pennsylvania in August of 2019, it felt like a daily pop quiz, one where I was graded on a language I still struggle to speak.</p>

<p>I heard students say things like: I think I want to work in mergers and acquisitions. Do you have any interest in that? It's very competitive, just so you know. And: Unless it's Goldman or J.P. Morgan, who cares?</p>

<p>I wondered how I missed the memo that I needed to take microeconomics. This fall at Penn there are 672 seats in the course; as of Monday, only four had not been taken. Does everyone like economics that much?</p>

<p>I later learned that according to student lore, if you do well in microeconomics and macroeconomics, then get accepted into one of the selective finance clubs, you have a chance of internally transferring to Penn's Wharton School, the most prestigious undergraduate business school in the country. A Wharton degree, popular superstition has it, is akin to buying a home in the Hamptons and sending your kids to one of the Phillips academies.</p>

<p>Responding to the pressure, I took microeconomics. When I did well on my first midterm, I realized that I could perhaps earn some respect from my peers by winning one of the few transfer spots into Wharton. Then I remembered I had no interest in business.</p>

<p>I wanted to go to law school, so I applied to Penn's Undergraduate Law Journal. During my callback interview, however, I failed to prepare questions for my interviewer, wrongly believing questions would be a nuisance. When I got a rejection email, I was crushed. I felt as if law school was now an impossibility.</p>

<p>It sounds silly — in hindsight, it was — but that is how I felt when I was surrounded by thousands of intelligent classmates competing for the same handful of results. I'd wake up at 3:30 a.m. from the recurring nightmare that I didn't land an internship my junior year summer. I heard people, maybe friends, endlessly discussing the "only way" to be successful. I consoled a sobbing roommate after she failed to land the job her parents expected her to get.</p>

<p>There is some economic reality behind the madness.</p>

<p>Real wages have remained moribund since the 1970s, a hard pill to swallow in the face of the last several years of inflation. Today's young adults feel worse off than their parents because their salaries no longer buy a suburban starter home with a picket fence. House prices have outpaced inflation, making homeownership a bigger challenge. Gen Z-ers have more student loans than millennials, and big, corporate salaries seemingly promise a salve for all of one's financial worries.</p>

<p>But what is missing in this race to perceived economic safety is the emotional toll. The number of young adults ages 18 to 25 who have had at least one depressive episode has doubled from 2010 to 2020. Almost two-thirds of college students have reported feeling "overwhelming anxiety" within a given year, and experts have pointed to the cocktail of coursework, pressure to participate in extracurricular activities and concerns over choosing a career as causes.</p>

<p>Naturally, when thousands of students rush into the same handful of majors and professions, supply will exceed demand. That's particularly true now, as openings for postgraduate tech industry jobs advertised on the student job board Handshake decreased about 30 percent this spring from the prior year. Job openings in the financial sector are similarly declining. Consulting firms have cut numbers of new hires and delayed start dates for undergraduates with offers.</p>

<p>Selective colleges and universities can fix this by overhauling their on-campus recruiting systems to prevent finance and consulting firms from pushing students to commit earlier and earlier. No student should have to determine her first career path before junior year begins.</p>

<p>Then there are the parents, who have enormous influence on their children's career choices. Take a deep breath. A kid's first word doesn't need to be "revenue" or his first language Java. It's hard to not want the best for your children — and not to define it as them starting the next Amazon. But stop and think about what actually makes them happy and keeps them sane, not what you think will keep them safe.</p>

<p>As for me, I was wrong: My failure to get admitted to the law journal in college didn't prevent me from getting into law school. I'm now a second-year law student and a member of my school's law review, and I still cannot confidently define management consulting.</p>

<p>But as soon as this essay is published, feel free to check out my LinkedIn post about it.</p>

                text: `<p>In the spring of 2024, our junior year, just hours after student activists pitched their tents in Harvard Yard to form a pro-Palestine encampment, The Harvard Crimson's editorial board, a body of opinion writers that meets thrice weekly to write editorials for Harvard's student newspaper, convened to discuss the history unfolding just a block away.</p>

<p>As the board's chairs, we contended that night with extraordinary circumstances. Our team was among the few organizations on campus that brought into dialogue students with starkly contrasting views of the Israel-Hamas war. Some of our members were staunchly pro-Israel Jews, while others were staunchly pro-Palestinian, including several with family members in the region. One of us, Jacob, was the president of Harvard Hillel, Harvard's main center for Jewish life. A few members Zoomed into our meeting that night from the encampment's tents and a handful joined from home, where they were observing Passover.</p>

<p>It was an extraordinary day. And yet it was not extraordinary for the editorial board. Our large, opinionated team was able to convene, discuss the issues civilly and argue that Harvard shouldn't deploy the police against peaceful protesters — a perspective we collectively accepted as the board's despite our individual disagreements. We had laid that groundwork months earlier, bolstering existing ground rules and instituting a suite of new ones to improve our ability to have cordial, professional discussions, even in the most unusual, stressful circumstances.</p>

<p>The success of these reforms upends the belief that lively, respectful discourse is no longer possible at places like Harvard.</p>

<p>The collegiality that characterized board discussions that spring marked a noticeable change from a couple of years earlier. When we joined The Crimson as freshmen, the editorial board was seen as left-wing and largely unwelcoming of even centrist views. While most board meetings did not touch on especially controversial issues and were cordial affairs, when they did, disagreement could become contentious.</p>

<p>A 2023 board meeting about the Supreme Court's ban on affirmative action in university admissions was emblematic of this problem. (We both attended, though we did not become the board's chairs until the end of 2023, midway through our junior year.) A Pew Research Center poll conducted that year found that half of American adults disapproved of selective colleges considering race and ethnicity in admissions — hardly a niche view. Yet despite robust national disagreement on the issue, the few contrarian comments voiced in that meeting elicited head shakes, eye rolls and several disdainful rebuttals from other board members. (The editorial board's policy is to keep the contents of meetings private, so we offer only a general characterization of what took place.)</p>

<p>Too often, we saw views diverging from the board's progressive slant meet with frowns, muttering and other subtle but unmistakably discouraging reactions. Less common but just as harmful were ad hominem attacks and overly emotional appeals to personal experience that frustrated constructive debate.</p>

<p>On the occasions that meetings went awry, we published editorials that were unpersuasive and ultimately discrediting. In one instance, we greeted news that Harvard would provide a one-time grant of $2,000 to all low-income students with criticism that the grants were "meager." In another, after an uncomfortable meeting about the lukewarm reaction to a campus performance by a Black R&B artist, we said students were failing to apply a "bare minimum level of cultural appreciation."</p>

<p>The Crimson had already paid a price for this conformist tendency when it came to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. In 2022 the board published a weak editorial supporting the boycott, divestment, sanctions movement against Israel. Without meaningfully grappling with opposing views or much discussion of Israel's actual conduct in Gaza and the West Bank, the editorial failed a basic test: Could this persuade someone who doesn't already agree with it?</p>

<p>The backlash was swift: The Crimson faced condemnation from a U.S. senator and several prominent Harvard faculty members, while our members contended with doxxing, online harassment and threats so severe that campus police stepped up security around our building. Concerned in part by past experience, a year and a half later the board avoided publishing any editorials about the Oct. 7, 2023, Hamas attack on Israel for several weeks, even as Harvard became a focus in the story about the ripple effects of the war in America.</p>

<p>How could such an organization evolve to first debate and then write about Israel so reasonably?</p>

<p>To start, our predecessors put a great deal of thought into how to facilitate difficult discussions and led us through our first two meetings about Israel and Gaza after Oct. 7, which were challenging but resulted in two principled, powerful editorials.</p>

<p>Both leading up to and especially at the start of our tenure as the board's chairs, several Jewish students, frustrated by what they saw as its anti-Israel leanings, joined the board. In meetings they took positions that had at times gone unvoiced, providing a personal perspective on a conflict that, thousands of miles away, could feel abstract.</p>

<p>Initially, we worried that an influx of board members with different views on Israel could make meetings even more contentious. But we built on our nascent progress, in large part because of policies we strengthened or introduced at the start of 2024: We would have zero tolerance for declaring dissenting views off-limits or reacting to them in ways that conveyed as much; we would make clear that arguments grounded in personal experience had an important place, but discourage rants or overly emotional comments that could chill speech; and we would intervene — readily, calmly and firmly — when these principles were violated.</p>

<p>We also made broader reforms to improve the quality of our meetings, banning laptops (long a source of distraction) and requiring more regular attendance, which led board members to know and trust one another better. As moderators, we fact-checked remarks more assiduously and discouraged aimless or redundant contributions.</p>

<p>None of these changes came easily.</p>

<p>The two of us faced a measure of internal criticism, but we consistently underscored the importance of principled, rational disagreement. Meeting by meeting, the board rallied behind this approach. Disagreeing civilly about big stories — the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, but also D.E.I., free speech and admissions policies — became routine, and we published thoughtful editorials that helped earn back disillusioned readers' respect. Refined by dissent, our editorials, regardless of their ideological tilt, offered stronger reasoning and more engagement with counterarguments. They passed the test our previous editorials on controversial issues had too often failed.</p>

<p>Increasingly, we're told that it's almost impossible for difficult conversations to happen on college campuses anymore. Three times a week, during two of the most divisive semesters in Harvard's history, our team proved that analysis wrong.</p>

<p>The heart of the issue is our habits of discussion — how we tend to react when we find ourselves in the majority.</p>

<p>We're dubious that merely admitting more centrists and conservatives to universities like Harvard will improve the state of dialogue on campus. And we're appalled by President Trump's assault on higher education, clearly undertaken, at least in part, under the guise of remedying the issues with campus discourse.</p>

<p>To us, the solution is deceptively simple. Universities should create environments where students with different views must talk to one another routinely and establish ground rules that ensure they do so without distractions or prejudgment.</p>

<p>Illiberalism on college campuses isn't inevitable. At The Crimson, it took only a few months to radically improve.</p>

                text: `<p><strong>Bologna, Italy</strong> — This city is a porticoed, often eerie and shadowy medieval place, the setting of many Italian mystery novels and even a John Grisham thriller. As a college student spending part of my junior year abroad, I haven't always felt completely safe here. But then came news of the sexual assault and killing of a British student, Meredith Kercher, in Perugia. The police are holding her American roommate, Amanda Knox, and Ms. Knox's Italian boyfriend as suspects. Now, this place seems to be a little wary of me.</p>

<p>Every day brings a new headline or television report about Amanda Knox. "Man-hunter, insatiable in bed," was the first line in an article in Corriere della Sera, Italy's leading daily newspaper. "She lives only for pleasure," La Repubblica reported.</p>

<p>Not only is Perugia, like Bologna, a university city that is considered one of the premier places for language and culture study abroad, but Amanda is a girl my exact age, 20, from my hometown, Seattle. Because of her story, which has dominated the news in Europe, and not just in the tabloids, life as an American student abroad is not at all what I expected.</p>

<p>I came here imagining I'd have to answer the numerous questions about the war, our unpopular president and our cultural exports that still dominate Italian television. Italians love to argue. And while I have had many late-night discussions about America's failings, it's been nothing like the storm of more personal attention that has come with Ms. Knox's arrest.</p>

<p>A few days after the Nov. 1 murder, Corriere della Sera ran a story about Seattle that described it as known for rain, dark forests and a high number of serial killers. The paper even went so far as to suggest that Kurt Cobain, the singer for Nirvana who committed suicide in Seattle, may have been the inspiration for Amanda's "refined grunge" style and interest in drugs.</p>

<p>I love my hometown. My tiny room here, which I am told was once part of the former servants' quarters of a wealthy Emilia-Romagna merchant family, is plastered in pictures of Mount Rainier, Puget Sound and the Space Needle. I've always been excited to tell people where I am from. At the beginning of the semester I would usually say, "Yeah, I'm from Seattle. You know ... Starbucks? Nirvana? Boeing? Bill Gates?"</p>

<p>These don't get much reaction.</p>

<p>"'Grey's Anatomy?'"</p>

<p>"Ahh, si si si! See-att-tole! Of course, 'Grey's Anatomy'!" (Let me just say that Dr. McDreamy is even dreamier dubbed in a deep Italian baritone.)</p>

<p>Since this murder, to be a college student from Seattle has become shorthand for something else. Ms. Knox has been called "una bugiarda" (liar), "L'Americana," or my personal favorite, "La Luciferina." Even worse, her image-destroying online postings, in which she appears to be inebriated, have become part of this media circus. Italians have gotten all too well acquainted with "la studentessa di Seattle" (thanks again for the great press). Laughing about her constantly changing alibi, they now often refer to her just as "Amanda."</p>

<p>And of course there was that unfortunate online name she gave herself: "Foxyknoxy."</p>

<p>So these days I am not exactly shouting the name of my hometown to bystanders in the piazza. "You're from Seattle?" people will say. "Isn't that where that wild American student is from?" Anticipating the next question, I quickly add, "And no, I don't know her."</p>

<p>American college students already have to live down a stereotype of their own making. Hordes of them drunkenly parade or literally pub crawl past Renaissance masterpieces on the streets of Florence at 4 a.m., shouting clichés like "Ciao, bella!" and "La vita è bella!" Add in our often laughable pronunciation of Dante's beautiful language and our sinfully casual dress — the North Face fleece college uniform sharing the streets with Dolce & Gabbana-strutting Italian babes — and you can see why it's an uphill struggle.</p>

<p>It's bad enough that the dollar is at a record low and that President Bush is about as popular here as Chinese food. Not to mention, I'm always trying to explain that "The O.C." isn't real life and that's not how most people in the United States live.</p>

<p>Now throw in the blue-eyed studentessa, a poster girl for college debauchery. To read the articles about Amanda Knox, you would think that all American students are hash-smoking party girls with little memory of their weekends.</p>

<p>This makes the foreign immersion process so much more difficult. We college students come here to learn Italian, study new things, live on our own outside the American cocoon, experience the culture and form relationships with the people and the country. And Bologna should be the perfect place for this. Umberto Eco is a professor here, at what claims to be the world's oldest university, and Prime Minister Romano Prodi lives down the street in a rather typical ochre-colored Bolognese house. Plus, a pizza margherita, at under three euros, is one of the most affordable eating pleasures in the world.</p>

<p>So, I haven't given up. This country has far too much to offer for me to let an incident like this tarnish my experience. Sure, answering the question "Where are you from?" is a bit more awkward, but it certainly gets the conversations going. And after all, that is what I came here to do.</p>

                title: "Why We're Impeaching Our Student Body President Over Trump Jr.",
                author: "Zachariah Chou",

                text: `<p><strong>GAINESVILLE, Fla.</strong> — On Oct. 10, Donald Trump Jr. and the former Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle gave a speech at the University of Florida for $50,000 at the invitation of our student body president, Michael Murphy. Students protested, and normally that would have been the end of the story.</p>

<p>Instead, last week, a group of other student body senators and I initiated impeachment proceedings against Mr. Murphy over what we feel is a gross abuse of his power. In the resulting days, our campus drama has become national news, and Mr. Murphy has become a conservative martyr. (Full disclosure: I ran for student body president against Mr. Murphy earlier this year and lost.)</p>

<p>For many of his supporters, this is simply another story of campus leftists gone berserk and threatening free speech. In fact, it's a much more complicated story, one that throws into question the use of public funds for partisan ends.</p>

<p>Michael Murphy has posted photos of himself on social media at President Trump's inauguration and with Education Secretary Betsy DeVos in the White House. He is the son of Dan Murphy, who works for the lobbying firm BGR Group. Dan Murphy maxed out donations to President Trump's 2020 campaign, and is a known associate of Donald Trump Jr. The $50,000 that paid for the speaking fee came from mandatory student fees.</p>

<p>In response to our impeachment inquiry, the student body president hired Daniel Nordby — the one-time general counsel of the former Florida governor and current senator Rick Scott — as his attorney. Mr. Scott called Mr. Murphy's pending impeachment "shameful." On Nov. 14 the Florida Republican Party publicized a page on its website where supporters can add their name to support Mr. Murphy (and, one click below that, "contribute to keep America great"). That same day, Donald Trump Jr. tweeted colorful language about the Murphy impeachment inquiry and added, "Enough of this nonsense."</p>

<p>After the Oct. 10 event, a University of Florida alumna, Mariana Castro, submitted a public records request for all emails to and from Mr. Murphy concerning the invitation of the president's son to campus. Her request returned an email thread from Caroline Wren, a veteran Republican fund-raiser. Ms. Wren works as a financial consultant for the Trump Victory Committee, a joint entity between the Trump 2020 re-election campaign and the Republican National Committee.</p>

<p>On Sept. 11, Ms. Wren sent an email to Mr. Murphy referring to a Fourth of July meeting with him at her house. She added that she "would like to bring Donald Trump Jr., Kimberly Guilfoyle and R.N.C. co-chairman Tommy Hicks to the University of Florida."</p>

<p>When our local paper, The Independent Florida Alligator, called Ms. Wren for comment on Oct. 30, she first stated that she didn't know who Mr. Murphy was — which for sure doesn't raise any eyebrows at all. Ms. Wren later responded via email to The Alligator, acknowledging that she and Mr. Murphy met over the summer. She insisted she had been acting in her personal capacity and that she "mistakenly forgot to remove my Trump Victory signature."</p>

<p>Many people saw these emails as the smoking gun, as proof that Mr. Murphy had colluded with the Trump campaign to funnel student fees toward a partisan cause.</p>

<p>The emails were the final straw for me and my colleagues in the Student Government Senate.</p>

<p>On Nov. 12, we filed an impeachment resolution against our student body president for using student fees to advance his own expressed political beliefs and for violating our governing laws (specifically 808.12, Part 5) that forbid student government funds from being used to support a political party.</p>

<p>And that was supposed to be it. Naturally, The Alligator reported on it. Then the Tampa Bay Times. The story continued to gather momentum, bolstered by the striking similarity to what is going on at the federal level.</p>

<p>Conservative commentators have glanced in our direction and bemoaned the death of free speech on college campuses. The Florida Federation of College Republicans lamented that our student government has used "funds for years to promote liberal speakers."</p>

<p>Reality doesn't quite match up with the assertions of those who claim to be persecuted; as I've written previously, the vast majority of the political speakers that our student government has brought in and paid for in the last three years are conservative. On the conservative side, the former Ohio governor John Kasich came to campus in January; the former Republican presidential candidate Carly Fiorina and political commentator Ben Shapiro spoke in 2017. On the liberal side, we held events with Kal Penn, associate director in the White House Office of Public Engagement in the Obama administration, and the comedian Chelsea Handler in 2017.</p>

<p>For the record, we do not try to impeach our student body president after every conservative speaking event on campus. Since the University of Florida opened its doors in Gainesville in 1906, there has been only one other impeachment inquiry into a student body president; in 2009, Kevin Reilly was investigated over various concerns, including violations of the Florida Sunshine Law and conspiring to keep minority-party senators out of committee seats. He was ultimately not impeached and, interestingly enough, eventually went on to work in Governor Scott's administration.</p>

<p>The Florida Republican Party seems to think that the impeachment inquiry is solely about inviting a member of the Trump family to campus, but that is not the case. My fellow senators and I have no qualms with free speech. This is an issue of conflicts of interest and fiscal responsibility, revolving around how $50,000 in mandatory student fees ended up going down the drain, in the direction of the swamp.</p>

<p>The Trump event at the University of Florida wasn't "free speech" but instead a "$50,000 speech." Many have framed the event as a great bargain, citing how much more money we've spent on other speakers, like Pitbull or Aly Raisman. I wasn't convinced. I consider Donald Trump Jr. to be a barren banana stand in the marketplace of ideas. No one would ever mistake him for an intellectual or accomplished individual, so why pay him even close to such?</p>

<p>Less than two weeks after his appearance at the University of Florida, the junior Mr. Trump spoke at Grand Canyon University and Colorado State University. Last week, he was booed (by the far right) at the University of California, Los Angeles.</p>

<p>None of these universities paid speaking fees or used student fees (though at least one, Grand Canyon University, did supply the space and pay for security); these events were organized through and paid for by the conservative group Turning Point USA, a group that also claims to have influenced student government elections all over the country, including at the University of Florida.</p>

<p>To sidestep our allegations, Mr. Murphy's attorney has insisted that the president's son was brought to campus to promote his book, "Triggered: How the Left Thrives on Hate and Wants to Silence Us," — so that it wasn't a campaign event. (The book was published on Nov. 5, 26 days after his speech.)</p>

<p>If that was the case, then shouldn't the event have been free? It's not a stretch to imagine that he is already making money off his book, a No. 1 best seller, boosted by bulk purchases from the Republican National Committee.</p>

<p>We didn't see $50,000 flowing to him at his other book tour stops, so why did it happen at the University of Florida?</p>

<p>Paying $50,000 for a speech that could have literally been a free speech is ethically questionable, especially seeing how Ms. Wren, a financial consultant for the Trump re-election campaign, was involved in setting up the speaking event — and that Michael Murphy's lobbyist father has already maxed out his contributions to the campaign.</p>

<p>At the end of the day, had Donald Trump Jr. come to the University of Florida in the same way that he visited other universities, we would not had initiated impeachment proceedings against our student body president. It is the money questionably spent, conflicts of interest and shady Trump campaign collusion that are the sole ingredients in this recipe for impeachment.</p>

<p>Just as they are doing with the hearings in Washington, Republicans will try to pass this off as another day of partisan politics, but it's not. This is about right and wrong, and just like our counterparts in Congress, we are taking a stand for ethical behavior in politics. We demand accountability.</p>

                text: `<p>"I never pegged you for a dropout," a family friend said when I moved back home to sleepy Owensboro, Ky., after my freshman year of college.</p>

<p>In high school I had been a stereotypical overachiever. Because my grades were good, I had little doubt that I'd excel in college. Instead, I did the opposite. I froze.</p>

<p>There has been a lot of media coverage about students who fear failure so much that it affects everything from their grades to their mental health, but there seem to be misconceptions about where this fear comes from. It's easy to dismiss young people as "soft" or desperate for participation trophies, but fear of failure is far more complex.</p>

<p>I never thought I would be the best student on campus and never expected to be treated as if I were outstanding. I was prepared for a bad grade or rejection letter here or there. I was not prepared for feeling like I didn't fit in, that there was no place for me on a campus where everyone told me I should be having the time of my life. I wasn't afraid of failing as a student; I was afraid of failing as a person.</p>

<p>Somewhat blindly, I'd chosen to attend a conservative college an hour away from where I grew up. I joined clubs, studied rigorously and rushed a sorority despite finding elements of Greek culture disturbing. But I struggled to conform to campus life.</p>

<p>I had trained to be a professional ballet dancer in high school and was used to hard work so at first I thought that I just needed to try harder to take advantage of college. I continued to go through the motions but grew increasingly anxious. Simple things — like talking to other students or getting through a lecture — grew into insurmountable challenges. Things I knew I was capable of doing well became daunting; the emotional paralysis of it all left me even more depressed.</p>

<p>As children, we're trained to avoid failure, not learn from it. It's presented as a sign of inadequacy, even worthlessness. I think this is the hidden cost of a K-12 curriculum that is achievement-oriented. Failure is never presented to us as a different kind of educational experience, a universal (and ceaseless) part of being human.</p>

<p>As a result, I saw my mounting inadequacies as proof that my life was falling apart. After all, there was no rational reason I should have been unhappy. I believed that if I were truly qualified to be where I was, I wouldn't be struggling at all.</p>

<p>I went from being a confident literature nerd hoping to earn a Ph.D. to a voiceless, slumped student who cowered behind her desk. I stopped raising my hand and started hiding in the back of the classroom, afraid to speak up and publicly humiliate myself. I dropped classes and opted out of study abroad. I stopped eating and lost handfuls of hair.</p>

<p>At the end of that year, I quit my sorority and withdrew from college.</p>

<p>That's when I had to confront the fact that the worst thing I could imagine had happened: I'd failed. But strangely, because it couldn't be undone and there was nowhere to go but forward, it was easier to rebuild.</p>

<p>Basically, after I left school, life opened up. I became comfortable learning about the world in a way that wasn't scripted by a syllabus. To pay my bills, I taught ballet lessons and was soon doing administrative work for my old ballet studio. Because I liked writing, I volunteered for communications internships at nonprofits, which gave me professional writing experience that I'd never have gained in an English class. In the two years after dropping out, I founded a community yoga studio and worked my way up to being a director of public relations at an arts organization.</p>

<p>Motivated by these successes, I realized I was furthering my own education, and I was pretty sure I'd never go back to college.</p>

<p>But I did wish there was a way for me to finish my degree. One night while I was searching online, I came across the New School — one of a handful of universities that offer academic credit for real-world experience and knowledge gained outside of the classroom. The prior-learning credit program at the New School counts on-the-job training, volunteer work, military service and creative arts endeavors as academic credits.</p>

<p>I submitted an application that explained how my out-of-school experiences in ballet and in nonprofit communications could be comparable to courses the university offered in subjects like online journalism and ballet technique. The New School offered me what amounted to a full year of college credit, which considerably lessened the cost of attending.</p>

<p>I realize many students don't have the safety net that I did: I was fortunate to have parents who could help when I dropped out. But prior-learning programs aren't only for students like me. People of all ages and backgrounds can apply to schools that offer credit for life experience. These programs reveal the value of what its students have already accomplished and build on that, instead of encouraging many of us misfits to focus on the formal education we lack.</p>

<p>College is often cast as the best four years of your life, but the reality is that too many students are anxious, overworked and paralyzed by the idea that one false move or rough patch will destroy their future. We would be better served if we were told that failure, while normal, is always unexpected, and that it is usually a useful lesson in something bigger.</p>

<p>Most important, students aren't all alike, and the college experience doesn't need to be one-size-fits-all. I earned my degree at 23 years old. My biggest lesson? Failing my freshman year was the best thing for my education.</p>

                text: `<p>Last week, some of the world's leading climate change scientists confirmed that humans are making irreversible changes to our planet and extreme weather will only become more severe. This news is a "code red for humanity," said the United Nations secretary general.</p>

<p>It is — but young people like us have been sounding this alarm for years. You just haven't listened.</p>

<p>On Aug. 20, 2018, one child staged a lone protest outside the Swedish Parliament, expecting to stay for three weeks. Tomorrow we will mark three years since Greta Thunberg's strike. Even earlier, brave young people from around the world spoke out about the climate crisis in their communities. And today, millions of children and young people have united in a movement with one voice, demanding that decision makers do the work necessary to save our planet from the unprecedented heat waves, massive floods and vast wildfires we are increasingly witnessing. Our protest will not end until the inaction does.</p>

<p>For children and young people, climate change is the single greatest threat to our futures. We are the ones who will have to clean up the mess you adults have made, and we are the ones who are more likely to suffer now. Children are more vulnerable than adults to the dangerous weather events, diseases and other harms caused by climate change, which is why a new analysis released Friday by UNICEF is so important.</p>

<p>The Children's Climate Risk Index provides the first comprehensive view of where and how this crisis affects children. It ranks countries based on children's exposure to climate and environmental shocks, as well as their underlying vulnerability to those shocks.</p>

<p>It finds that virtually every child on the planet is exposed to at least one climate or environmental hazard right now. A staggering 850 million, about a third of all the world's children, are exposed to four or more climate or environmental hazards, including heat waves, cyclones, air pollution, flooding or water scarcity. A billion children, nearly half the children in the world, live in "extremely high risk" countries, the UNICEF researchers report.</p>

<p>This is the world being left to us. But there is still time to change our climate future. Around the world, our movement of young activists continues to grow.</p>

<p>In Bangladesh, Tahsin Uddin, 23, saw the impacts of climate change in his village and other coastal areas and was moved to action. He is passionate about climate education and has created a network of young journalists and educators to spread awareness, all while organizing cleanups of waterways teeming with plastic waste pollution.</p>

<p>In the Philippines, Mitzi Jonelle Tan, 23, has had to complete her homework by candlelight as typhoons raged outside and wiped out her community's electricity. She told us there were times she was afraid of drowning in her own bedroom as water flooded in. Now she is leading youth in her country to respond to the aftermath of those typhoons and other hazards through sharing food, water, clothes and support with the most affected communities.</p>

<p>In Zimbabwe, Nkosi Nyathi, 18, is worried about a potential food crisis if weather patterns continue. Heat waves made school a challenging experience for him and his peers. Now he speaks to leaders from around the world to demand the inclusion of young people in decisions that affect their future.</p>

<p>The fundamental goal of the adults in any society is to protect their young and do everything they can to leave a better world than the one they inherited. The current generation of adults, and those that came before, are failing at a global scale.</p>

<p>The Children's Climate Risk Index reveals a disturbing global inequity when it comes to the worst effects of climate change. Thirty-three countries, including the Central African Republic, Chad, Nigeria and Guinea, are considered extremely high-risk for children, but those countries collectively emit just 9 percent of global carbon dioxide emissions. The 10 countries with the highest emissions, including China, the United States, Russia and Japan, collectively account for nearly 70 percent of global emissions. And children in those higher-emitting states face lower risks: Only one of these countries, India, is ranked as extremely high-risk in the UNICEF report.</p>

<p>Many higher-risk countries are poorer nations from the global south, and it's there that people will be most impacted, despite contributing the least to the problem. We will not allow industrialized countries to duck responsibility for the suffering of children in other parts of the world. Governments, industry and the rest of the international community must work together to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, as 195 nations committed to do in the Paris Climate Agreement of 2015.</p>

<p>We have less than 100 days until the U.N. Climate Change Conference, also known as COP26, in Glasgow. The world's climate scientists have made it clear that the time is now — we must act urgently to avoid the worst possible consequences. The world's young people stand with the scientists and will continue to sound the alarm.</p>

<p>We are in a crisis of crises. A pollution crisis. A climate crisis. A children's rights crisis. We will not allow the world to look away.</p>

                text: `<p><strong>BURBANK, Calif.</strong> — In late 2020, when the Burbank Unified School District removed five classic novels from mandatory reading lists in my city's classrooms, I started a petition to protest the decision. The petition, which is still open, has more than 5,000 signatures.</p>

<p>I was a sophomore at Burbank High School at the time and had read four of the five books in school — "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" by Mark Twain, "Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry" by Mildred D. Taylor, "To Kill a Mockingbird" by Harper Lee and "The Cay" by Theodore Taylor. The fifth, "Of Mice and Men" by John Steinbeck, I read on my own a few years earlier.</p>

<p>The books were being removed from the core curriculum, according to Matt Hill, the superintendent of the Burbank Unified district, after complaints from students and parents that the depictions of racism and language in these works — particularly the use of the N-word — caused harm to Black students.</p>

<p>My position was this: I acknowledged that Black students were being marginalized in our classrooms (I was sympathetic, too; I am all too familiar with the demeaning nature of racism) — but did not think that it was the fault of these books or their content. I believed, and still believe, that the solution was not to remove the books but to add books written by people of color and to better train teachers to teach these books sensitively to students.</p>

<p>As the petition attracted signatures, I spoke at several school board meetings on the issue. I recall one meeting in particular. I had prepared to talk about how these novels helped shape me both as a student and as a human being. I spoke briefly about how reading the story of a Black family in the Deep South in "Roll of Thunder, Hear My Cry," under the guidance of a caring teacher, had moved me to tears and to a commitment to learn more about the resilience and resistance of the people upon whose backs this country was built. I explained how these class experiences helped move me and some fellow students from complacent private citizens to people who today are deeply involved in the fight for social justice.</p>

<p>There was more I could have said: How Atticus Finch's defense of Tom Robinson in "To Kill a Mockingbird" taught me the danger of complacency; how the unlikely friendships of Huckleberry Finn and Jim in "Adventures of Huckleberry Finn" or Phillip Enright and Timothy in "The Cay" taught me that love transcends any and all differences.</p>

<p>But standing on the boardroom floor as comments from others in the meeting began, I witnessed the public forum — made up mostly of parents, administrators and educators — devolve into tribalist dissension. The meeting quickly became a two-sided shouting match pitting supposed "freedoms" against purported "justice." There was plenty of arguing but little or no meaningful discussion on why those novels were in question or what students would lose or gain by a ban against them.</p>

<p>At that moment, I had a long-overdue realization: How we as Americans approach restrictions on literature curriculums is not only flawed but also wholly reactionary. My experience at that meeting and others convinced me that the problem is not that we disagree but how. We need to shift focus away from reflexive outrage about restrictions and bans and toward actual discussions of the merits and drawbacks of the individual books.</p>

<p>Nearly a year and a half later, the Burbank book restriction is still in place, and more have been approved in schools and school districts across the country. A report from PEN America this month found that 86 school districts in the United States have banned 1,586 books in the past year. From the Tennessee school board that decided "Maus," Art Spiegelman's graphic novel about the Holocaust, could no longer be taught, to the Oklahoma State Legislature's proposed law giving a parent of any student the power to enforce bans on books "of a sexual nature," to the sweeping removal of 130 books with sexual themes from school shelves at the request of a Texas superintendent, one element unites all the conflicts around these bans — a political and ideological partisanship that buys more into contemporary culture wars than into our students' education.</p>

<p>One fact often overlooked in these disputes is that both conservatives and liberals engage in book banning and removal when it suits their political goals. Burbank is a liberal stronghold where the majority of voters in the last five presidential elections cast ballots for Democrats; Granbury, the district in Texas that removed the 130 books this year for "pervasively vulgar" content or "pornography" — in what many believe is code speak to conceal prejudice against those who identify as L.G.B.T.Q. — is a conservative stronghold that voted Republican in those same five elections.</p>

<p>Americans, conditioned to resist violations of our "freedom" at every turn, tend to reflexively reject any literary censorship. But we often forget that these types of book bans aren't instituting a nationalized book burning or punishments for reading the books; rather, they are often decisions about whether certain groups of children are emotionally or developmentally ready for certain books. The truth is that all schools have curriculums and that deciding what is included and what is not is a crucial responsibility that involves subjective decisions about what is best for students. And I do want to give this notion some deference.</p>

<p>When I was 10, I found myself voraciously reading all things related to World War II; along that path, I picked up a copy of Iris Chang's 1997 book, "The Rape of Nanking." Two chapters in, as the executions of innocent children my age were described in detail, I learned that the contents of the historical account were just about as discomforting as the title itself. Terrified and upset, I put the book down and stored it deep in my closet.</p>

<p>Did my aversion to that book negate the severity of the war crimes that occurred on the Sino-Japanese front? Absolutely not. But did it show that I was probably too young to read it? Yes. Both principles can be simultaneously true: Certain books can be important to society while being upsetting or harmful to a child. We can and ought to reject the false binary being sold to us today, because there is some value in restricting curriculum to children when those decisions are informed by a knowledge of the books and the capacities of the students.</p>

<p>I hope that the adults who make the decisions about our schools and our educations and those who fuel the public arguments over them can put an end to their hyperpartisanship and help us to begin rigorous conversations about the content and value of the books themselves.</p>

<p>Because at that meeting I never did get to say my piece about what those other books had done for me.</p>

                text: `<p>Despite the horrific timing of his remarks, President Trump's defense of Confederate statues last week revealed a viewpoint that's widely held in this country — and not just by neo-Nazis or white supremacists. Plenty of Americans find themselves conflicted about recent efforts to remove monuments to the Confederacy, be they statues or the names of buildings, highways or schools.</p>

<p>This is especially true at my (beloved) alma mater. I'm a 2017 graduate of Washington and Lee University, which is named for George Washington, an early benefactor, and Robert E. Lee, who served as college president from 1865 until his death in 1870.</p>

<p>Over the past several years, some students have begun to advocate that the university do more to distance itself from our second namesake, while others have come to Lee's rescue with increasing vigor. As one peer wrote in a conservative campus publication called The Spectator, "Robert E. Lee evinced an unusual and relative show of honor and integrity that should not be slandered by his role in the Civil War."</p>

<p>I have many friends who share this opinion. Although they would never associate with white supremacists or attend alt-right rallies, they get upset at any suggestion that Washington and Lee change how it honors Lee's legacy on campus.</p>

<p>It's true that the retired Confederate general played an important role in our university's history. But if the Washington and Lee community is not more willing to critically evaluate one of our patron saints — and modify how we celebrate him — we only legitimize the "causes" of white supremacists who latch onto statues of men like Lee because they symbolize the subjugation of black people.</p>

<p>The school wasn't even always called Washington and Lee. Founded in 1749 as Augusta Academy, it was subsequently renamed Liberty Hall in 1776 and Liberty Hall Academy in 1782. It became Washington Academy in 1796, after George Washington donated some $20,000 worth of James River Canal stock to the institution, effectively saving it from financial ruin.</p>

<p>After the Civil War, Robert E. Lee was recruited to become college president of what was by then called Washington College, a post he accepted with reservations, worried that he "might draw upon the college a feeling of hostility." When he died in 1870, trustees voted to change the name of the school to Washington and Lee University.</p>

<p>In his short tenure, Lee nearly reinvented the place. He championed the sciences, joined the Lexington Law School to the college, introduced what would become our hallmark honor system and established some of America's first collegiate journalism and business classes, and he turned down more profitable jobs to do so. He worked to ensure that Northern and Southern students studied together and pledged to devote his "remaining energies to training young men to do their duty in life."</p>

<p>But this is the same Lee who led the Confederate army against the Union to preserve the status quo of slavery in our nation's bloodiest war. Lee is often defended as a product of his time, but at least one other Virginian, George Henry Thomas, became a notable Union general. Later, as a college president, Lee was also mostly unwilling to discipline students involved in attempted lynchings and kidnappings of black women who lived nearby.</p>

<p>Touring our campus, though, you wouldn't even guess that Lee was on the losing side of the Civil War.</p>

<p>Portraits of the man are prominently displayed, and three university buildings bear his name. One is the president's house, in which Lee died. The second, Lee-Jackson House, is home to the office of the dean of the college and is also named for Stonewall Jackson, Lee's military colleague in the Confederacy. The third building is Lee Chapel, which was commissioned by the retired general but not named for him until after his death.</p>

<p>Inside this campus landmark, where an altar might have been built, rests a gigantic, recumbent, marble statue of Lee, wearing Confederate battle gear and resting on a camp bed. (Lee is buried with his family in a mausoleum beneath the chapel.)</p>

<p>This year the Washington and Lee admissions department instructed tour guides to avoid showing the Lee Chapel interior to prospective students and families. There were a number of logistical reasons for this change: to showcase newer buildings and minimize the amount of time groups spent sitting inside the chapel, rather than actually touring the campus. But many people, including myself, also supported the policy because of that life-size statue, which makes Lee look like some sort of religious figure. It suggests a degree of lionization that isn't associated with most college presidents, let alone the famously treasonous.</p>

<p>To a number of other students and alumni, however, the administration seemed to be capitulating to political correctness.</p>

<p>Members of the student executive committee's subcommittee on traditions — yes, that's a thing at Washington and Lee — voiced discontent. An op-ed in The Spectator argued that the new policy be "reversed as soon as possible," largely because "Lee Chapel is the centerpiece of our university's historical heritage, and its importance reaches into all our lives as participants in this university community."</p>

<p>One comment on the article urged the college to keep Lee Chapel on the tour in order "to talk openly and candidly about history, not hide it."</p>

<p>And therein lies the rub. Stand-alone statues and portraits of Confederate leaders, devoid of any historical information except for perhaps a plaque, don't present a candid or nuanced account of history. They signal that these men are heroic and worthy of honor. Period.</p>

<p>Until 2014, my sophomore year, when a group of African-American students made several demands to improve the campus environment for people of color, the recumbent statue of Lee was also flanked by reproductions of the Confederate battle flag. Many students and alumni argued that the flags should remain in the chapel, even though, after the Civil War, Lee himself resisted memorials to the Confederate cause or displays of its flag.</p>

<p>I was a tour guide then. One afternoon while I was showing a group around campus, a mother stopped me midsentence to ask why an assembly of men dressed in gray and wielding Confederate flags was protesting in front of the chapel. I tried stalling for a few moments. What were we supposed to tell people again? Oh yes: "This is not typical at Washington and Lee. The protesters should be gone for good soon." But to my surprise, the mother on my tour praised them "for just celebrating their heritage."</p>

<p>An African-American family just happened to be with us. After that comment, they didn't ask any more questions about the school. They left right after the tour.</p>

<p>This scenario should be of much deeper concern to the campus community than whether Confederate battle flags fly in the chapel.</p>

<p>Those who feel strongly about commemorating certain positive aspects of Confederate leaders must therefore be specific about how they present these men, and they can't rely on the platitudes that white supremacists deploy. Southern secession was inextricably tied to upholding slavery, and postwar Confederate imagery surged in negative response to the 20th century's civil rights movement. We all have the duty to reject the narratives about heritage that have been popularized by those who strive to make Confederate pride more palatable.</p>

<p>I am not proposing that we scrub the campus of any mention of Lee. A new name for the college might well be appropriate — especially since we could revert to one of several former names — but the best defense against taking such drastic action is to be vigilantly honest about Lee's blemished legacy. History should be better contextualized on campus, and we should eschew any hagiographic imagery. That the chapel itself is named for Lee, who oversaw its construction, makes sense. But the life-size statue of the general, as well as portraits of him featuring Confederate iconography, should be moved to the Lee Chapel Museum. The museum itself, which now makes scant reference to Lee's Civil War days, must also critically engage with the offenses of a man who is the hero of plenty of children's books sold in the gift shop.</p>

<p>This is not an argument to vilify all flawed historical figures. I've heard some of my peers make the same "slippery slope" argument as President Trump did last week, when he tweeted, "Can't change history, but you can learn from it. Robert E Lee, Stonewall Jackson — who's next, Washington, Jefferson? So foolish!"</p>

<p>Yes, some critiques of Lee apply to Washington and Jefferson too — namely that all were slaveholders. But when we decide which famous Americans to memorialize, we should take their contributions to society into account. The founding fathers established the world's oldest, still-active Constitution, and they made equality the guiding vision of our country, however tragically limited it was when the Constitution was written. Robert E. Lee fought against this ideal. It's not hard to distinguish those who provided the intellectual framework for American rights from those who did everything they could to rend it apart.</p>

<p>It's easy to condemn the neo-Nazis and fanatics who rally around statues, waving Confederate flags and banners with swastikas. Still, there remain many nice, oftentimes well-meaning — though privileged — people in our country who imbue these radicals' hatred with a tinge of credibility. Such individuals, and I have unwittingly been one, do not speak in explicitly racist or militaristic terms about attempts to revisit the past or how to honor it. Yet they quietly breathe life into the South's racist, Lost Cause ideology by holding up Robert E. Lee as a paragon of heritage or virtue.</p>
